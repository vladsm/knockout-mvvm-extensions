The **MVVM extensions over the Knockout JS framework** provide solutions for some problems occuring while
creating code of the rich web client applications using javascript. Currently this library contains the following
components:

OO-coding style for the application code as well as for core infrustructure code (such as custom bindings for knockout etc.);

MVVM-styled implementation of the modal dialogs.

Later the functionality is supposed to be extended.
