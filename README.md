The **Knockout MVVM Extensions** provide solutions for some problems occuring while
creating code of the rich web client applications using javascript and Knockout JS framework.
Currently this library contains the following components:
+ support for OO-style for the application code as well as for core infrastructure code (such as 
custom bindings for knockout etc.);
+ MVVM-styled implementation of the modal dialogs.

Later the functionality is supposed to be extended.
